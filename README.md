# Dashboard-Interface

This repository contains the code for a basic, customizable, and visually appealing dashboard specifically designed for lightweight hosting on ESPressif network card chips. It currently features a simple design with a grid layout and six gauge charts that display random values, making it ideal for displaying real-time data from sensors or other devices connected to your ESPressif chip.

## Features

* **Clean and modern design:** A visually appealing and user-friendly interface with a dark theme.
* **Responsive design:** Adapts well to different screen sizes, ensuring accessibility on all devices, even with limited screen real estate.
* **Modular structure:** Components like the navigation menu, gauge charts, and main content areas are well-organized for customization and easy integration into your ESPressif project.
* **Interactive gauge charts:**  The gauge charts update dynamically with random values every 3 seconds, demonstrating a simple interactive element that can be used to visualize sensor data in real-time.
* **Lightweight and optimized:**  The code uses internal CSS and JavaScript, minimizing external dependencies for efficient performance on resource-constrained ESPressif chips.

## Technologies

* HTML
* CSS (Internal Styles)
* JavaScript (Internal Scripts)

## Getting Started

1. **Download the code:** Download or clone the repository.
2. **Adapt the code:** 
    * Modify the HTML structure to match your ESPressif project's requirements.
    * Update the CSS to align with your preferred design and branding.
    * Replace the random values in the JavaScript code with data received from your connected sensors or devices.
3. **Compile and upload:** Compile the code for your ESPressif chip using your preferred development environment (e.g., Arduino IDE, ESP-IDF) and upload it to your network card.
4. **Access the dashboard:** Open your ESPressif chip's IP address in a web browser on a connected device to view the dashboard.

## Future Development

This repository serves as a starting point for a more comprehensive dashboard for ESPressif projects. Future development will include:

* **Data integration:**  Connecting the dashboard to real data sources, such as sensors, actuators, or other ESPressif devices, to display meaningful information. 
* **Data visualization:** Implementing a wider range of chart types and visualization tools to represent data effectively. 
* **Interactivity:** Adding features like filtering, sorting, data drilling, and customizable views to enhance user interaction.
* **Testing:** Implementing unit tests and end-to-end tests to ensure code quality and reliability, especially for resource-constrained environments.
* **Additional components:** Incorporating more components like tables, graphs, maps, or custom widgets to enhance functionality.
